# Website Layout Composition Tool

This tool allows users to design website layouts without prior technical knowledge. Users can input URLs of websites they like and combine selected sections to create a new layout. It automatically segments pages, preserves design elements, and discards site-specific content. The result is a visual preview of the layout, which can be downloaded as HTML. The tool helps website owners communicate their vision more clearly and assists designers by speeding up layout creation.
